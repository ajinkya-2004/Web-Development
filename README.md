Description: Build a personal portfolio webpage.

HTML: Include sections for “About Me,” “Skills,” “Projects,” and “Contact.” Use semantic HTML5 tags appropriately (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, <article>).
CSS: Style your portfolio to be visually appealing. Use CSS selectors to target elements, apply the box model correctly, and implement a basic responsive design (e.g., using media queries for mobile-first or desktop-first approach, or simple Flexbox for layout on different screen sizes).
JavaScript: Add a simple interactive element. This could be:
A “dark mode” toggle button that changes the color scheme of the page.
A simple image carousel in the “Projects” section.
Form validation for the “Contact” form (e.g., checking if fields are empty before submission)
